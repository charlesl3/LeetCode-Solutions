# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

**Difficulty**: Medium

---

## **Problem Statement**

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in **O(n)** time.

---

## **Examples**

### **Example 1**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore, its length is 4.
```

---

## Approach

### Key Idea:
1. Use a **Hash Set** to store all numbers in the array for O(1) lookups.
2. Iterate through the array and find the starting points of consecutive sequences:
   - A number is the starting point if `(num - 1)` is not in the set.
3. For each starting point, count the length of the consecutive sequence by checking if `(num + 1)` exists in the set.

### Steps:
1. Convert the input list `nums` into a set to allow fast lookups.
2. Loop through each number in the set:
   - If `num - 1` is **not** in the set, it means `num` is the start of a new sequence.
   - Count how many consecutive numbers exist, starting from `num`.
3. Track the maximum sequence length during this process.
4. Return the maximum sequence length.

## Code Implementation

```python
def longestConsecutive(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    # Create a set of numbers for O(1) lookups
    num_set = set(nums)
    longest_streak = 0

    for num in num_set:
        # Only start counting if `num` is the start of a sequence
        if num - 1 not in num_set:
            current_num = num
            current_streak = 1

            # Count consecutive numbers
            while current_num + 1 in num_set:
                current_num += 1
                current_streak += 1

            # Update the longest streak
            longest_streak = max(longest_streak, current_streak)

    return longest_streak

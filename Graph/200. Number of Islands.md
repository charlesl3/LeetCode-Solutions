## Problem Description

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

### Example:
**Input:**
```plaintext
grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
1
```

### Code:
```python

class Solution(object):
    def numIslands(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not grid:
            return 0
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visited = set()
        islands = 0

        def dfs(r, c):
            # Boundary check and if cell is water or already visited
            if (r < 0 or c < 0 or
                r >= rows or c >= cols or
                grid[r][c] == "0" or
                (r, c) in visited):
                return
            # Mark the cell as visited
            visited.add((r, c))
            # Visit all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)
            dfs(r + 1, c)  # Down
            dfs(r, c + 1)  # Right
            dfs(r, c - 1)  # Left
            dfs(r - 1, c)  # Up
        
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                # Start DFS if cell is land and hasn't been visited
                if grid[r][c] == "1" and (r, c) not in visited:
                    dfs(r, c)  # Mark the entire island
                    islands += 1  # Increment island count

        return islands

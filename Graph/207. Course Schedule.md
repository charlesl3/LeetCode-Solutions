# 207. Course Schedule

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Status**: Solved  

---

## Problem Description

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

For example, the pair `[0, 1]` indicates that to take course `0`, you have to first take course `1`.  

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**:
```plaintext
numCourses = 2
prerequisites = [[1,0]], True


```
## Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def canFinish(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        """
        Determine if all courses can be completed given the prerequisites.

        :param numCourses: int - Total number of courses labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1
        :param prerequisites: List[List[int]] - Each pair [a, b] indicates course b must be taken before course a
        :return: bool - True if it's possible to complete all courses, False if there is a cycle (making it impossible)
        """
        from collections import deque

        # Step 1: Initialize the goto_course list and entering edges (in-degrees)
        goto_course = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]  # Adjacency list for each course showing courses that depend on it
        entering_edges = [0] * numCourses  # Array to track the number of entering edges (prerequisites) for each course

        # Step 2: Build the goto_course list from prerequisites and calculate entering edges
        for course, prereq in prerequisites:
            goto_course[prereq].append(course)  # Add course to the list of courses that depend on prereq
            entering_edges[course] += 1  # Increase the entering edges (prerequisites) of the course

        # Step 3: Queue courses with no entering edges (in-degree of 0)
        queue = deque([i for i in range(numCourses) if entering_edges[i] == 0])

        # Step 4: Process courses in topological order
        courses_processed = 0  # Counter for processed courses
        while queue:
            course = queue.popleft()  # Get the next course with no entering edges
            courses_processed += 1

            # Reduce the entering edges of each dependent course
            for next_course in goto_course[course]:
                entering_edges[next_course] -= 1  # Remove one entering edge (prerequisite)
                if entering_edges[next_course] == 0:  # If no more prerequisites, add to queue
                    queue.append(next_course)

        # Step 5: If all courses are processed, there was no cycle
        return courses_processed == numCourses

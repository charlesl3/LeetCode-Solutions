# 208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Status:** Solved  

---

## Problem Description

A **trie** (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the `Trie` class with the following methods:

- **`Trie()`**: Initializes the trie object.
- **`void insert(String word)`**: Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
- **`boolean search(String word)`**: Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.
- **`boolean startsWith(String prefix)`**: Returns `true` if there is a previously inserted string `word` that has the prefix `prefix`, and `false` otherwise.

## Example 1

**Input:**

```plaintext
["Trie", "insert", "search", "search", "startsWith", "insert", "search"]
[[], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"]]
```
**Output:**

```plaintext
[null, null, true, false, true, null, true]
```

## Code

```python

class Trie(object):

    def __init__(self):
        self.trie = {}

    def insert(self, word):
        """
        :type word: str
        :rtype: None
        """
        node = self.trie
        for char in word:
            # Move to the next node, creating it if it doesn't exist
            if char not in node:
                node[char] = {}
            node = node[char]
        # Mark the end of a word
        node['*'] = True
        
        

    def search(self, word):
        """
        :type word: str
        :rtype: bool
        """

        node = self.trie
        for char in word:
            # Move to the next node, creating it if it doesn't exist
            if char not in node:
                return False
            node = node[char]
        # Mark the end of a word
        return '*' in node
        

    def startsWith(self, prefix):
        """
        :type prefix: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        node = self.trie
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in node:
                return False
            node = node[char]
        return True

# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

**Solved**  
**Difficulty:** Medium  

---

## Problem Statement

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:  
> *“The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”*

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8`  
**Output:**  
`6`  
**Explanation:**  
The LCA of nodes `2` and `8` is `6`.

---

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:**  
The LCA of nodes `2` and `4` is `2`, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

---

### Example 3
**Input:**  
`root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1`  
**Output:**  
`2`

## Approach

### Algorithm:
1. Start at the root of the tree.
2. Compare the values of the root, `p`, and `q`:
   - If both `p.val` and `q.val` are **less than** `root.val`, the LCA is in the left subtree.
   - If both `p.val` and `q.val` are **greater than** `root.val`, the LCA is in the right subtree.
   - Otherwise, `root` is the LCA, as `p` and `q` are on opposite sides or one is equal to the `root`.
3. Use recursion or iteration to traverse the tree.

## Solution (Python)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type p: TreeNode
        :type q: TreeNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if not root:
            return None
        
        if p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        if p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        return root

# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Status:** Solved  

## Problem Statement  
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.  

The **diameter** of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.  

The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.  

---

## Example 1:  

**Input:**  
`root = [1,2,3,4,5]`  

**Output:**  
`3`  

**Explanation:**  
The longest path is `[4,2,1,3]` or `[5,2,1,3]`, which has `3` edges.  

```python

    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root):

        :type root: Optional[TreeNode]
        :rtype: int

            """
            if not node:
                return 0
            
            # Compute the height of left and right subtrees
            left_height = height_and_update_diameter(node.left)
            right_height = height_and_update_diameter(node.right)
            
            # Update the maximum diameter using the sum of left and right heights
            self.max_diameter = max(self.max_diameter, left_height + right_height)
            
            # Return the height of the current node
            return 1 + max(left_height, right_height)

        # Initialize the maximum diameter
        self.max_diameter = 0
        
        # Start the recursive height calculation
        height_and_update_diameter(root)
        
        # Return the maximum diameter found
        return self.max_diameter

# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree (not BST)

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Status:** Solved  

## Problem Statement  
Given a binary tree, find the **lowest common ancestor (LCA)** of two given nodes in the tree.  

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:  
> "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

---

## Example 1:  

**Input:**  
`root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1`  

**Output:**  
`3`  

**Explanation:**  
The LCA of nodes `5` and `1` is `3`.  

### Solution

```python

class Solution(object):
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type p: TreeNode
        :type q: TreeNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        # Base case: if the current node is None, p, or q, return it
        if not root or root == p or root == q:
            return root
        
        # Recursively search the left and right subtrees
        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        
        # If both left and right are non-None, root is the LCA
        if left and right:
            return root
        
        # Otherwise, return the non-None result (either left or right)
        return left if left else right

### Problem Description

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are **structurally identical** and the nodes have the **same value**.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

###Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isSameTree(self, p, q):
        # If both trees are None, they are the same
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        # If one of the trees is None while the other isn't, they are different
        if not p or not q:
            return False
        # If the values of the current nodes are different, they are different trees
        if p.val != q.val:
            return False

        
        # Recursively check the left subtree and right subtree
        return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)

### Problem Description

Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `true` if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values as `subRoot`, and `false` otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true
```

###Code

```python

class Solution(object):
    def isSubtree(self, root, subRoot):
        """
        :type root: Optional[TreeNode]
        :type subRoot: Optional[TreeNode]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        def isSameTree(p, q):
            # If both trees are None, they are the same
            if not p and not q:
                return True
            # If one of the trees is None while the other isn't, they are different
            if not p or not q:
                return False
            # If the values of the current nodes are different, they are different trees
            if p.val != q.val:
                return False
            return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and isSameTree(p.right, q.right)

        if not subRoot:
            return True
        if not root:
            return False
        if isSameTree(root, subRoot):
            return True
        return (self.isSubtree(root.left, subRoot) or
                self.isSubtree(root.right, subRoot))

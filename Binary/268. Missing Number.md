# 268. Missing Number

## Difficulty
**Easy**

---

## Problem Description

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

---

## Example 1
**Input:**  
`nums = [3, 0, 1]`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:** The range is `[0, 3]` and `2` is missing.

---

## Example 2
**Input:**  
`nums = [0, 1]`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:** The range is `[0, 2]` and `2` is missing.

---

## Example 3
**Input:**  
`nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]`  
**Output:**  
`8`  
**Explanation:** The range is `[0, 9]` and `8` is missing.

---

## Constraints
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the numbers in `nums` are **distinct**.

---

## Follow-Up
Could you implement a solution using only `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` extra space?

## Python Solution

```python
def missingNumber(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
    actual_sum = sum(nums)
    return expected_sum - actual_sum

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 0, 1]
print(missingNumber(nums))  # Output: 2

# 191. Number of 1 Bits
**Solved**  
**Easy**

## Topics
- Bit Manipulation

## Problem Statement
Given a positive integer `n`, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`n = 11` (binary: `1011`)

**Output:**  
`3`

**Explanation:**  
The binary representation of 11 is `1011`, which has three `1`s.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`n = 128` (binary: `10000000`)

**Output:**  
`1`

**Explanation:**  
The binary representation of 128 is `10000000`, which has one `1`.

### Constraints:
- The input number is a positive 32-bit integer.

## Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def hammingWeight(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        result = 0
        while n:
            result += n % 2  # Add the remainder when n is divided by 2 (1 if LSB is set)
            n //= 2          # Perform integer division to shift to the next bit
        return result

# 371. Sum of Two Integers

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Status:** Solved  

## Topics
- **Bit Manipulation**
- **Math**

## Problem Statement
Given two integers `a` and `b`, return the sum of the two integers **without using the operators `+` and `-`.**

You must solve this problem using bit manipulation.

### Constraints
- `-2³¹ <= a, b <= 2³¹ - 1`
- The solution must not use the `+` or `-` operators.

## Approach

The problem can be solved by using bit manipulation. The key operations involved are:
1. **XOR (^)** to calculate the sum without considering carry.
2. **AND (&) followed by left shift (<<)** to calculate the carry.

### Steps:
1. **Sum without carry**: The XOR of two numbers gives the sum of their bits, but without considering the carry.
2. **Carry**: The AND of two numbers gives the common bits, and left shifting them by one position will give the carry.
3. **Iterate**: Repeat the process until there’s no carry left.

The mask `0xFFFFFFFF` is used to handle negative numbers because Python integers are of arbitrary precision. However, in this problem, we need to simulate 32-bit overflow, so the mask helps in truncating the result to 32 bits.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def getSum(self, a, b):

        Adds two integers a and b without using the + and - operators.
        
        Parameters:
        a (int): First integer.
        b (int): Second integer.

        Returns:
        int: Sum of a and b.

        MASK = 0xFFFFFFFF
        # Mask to handle negative numbers (32-bit)
        INT_MAX = 0x7FFFFFFF

        while b != 0:
            # ^ gives sum without carry
            sum_without_carry = (a ^ b) & MASK
            # & and << 1 gives the carry
            carry = ((a & b) << 1) & MASK
            # update a and b
            a, b = sum_without_carry, carry

        # If a is negative, convert to Python's negative integer representation
        return a if a <= INT_MAX else ~(a ^ MASK)

# 55. Jump Game

**Difficulty:** Medium

---

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums`. Each element in the array represents your **maximum jump length** at that position. You are initially positioned at the first index.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`nums = [2,3,1,1,4]`  
**Output:**  
`true`  
**Explanation:**  
- Jump 1 step from index 0 to index 1.
- Then jump 3 steps from index 1 to the last index.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`nums = [3,2,1,0,4]`  
**Output:**  
`false`  
**Explanation:**  
- You will always arrive at index 3, but its maximum jump length is `0`, making it impossible to reach the last index.

---

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

---

## Solution: Python

### Greedy Approach
A greedy approach is effective for solving this problem. Track the farthest position that can be reached, and check if it's possible to reach the last index.

```python
def canJump(nums):
    """
    Determines if it's possible to reach the last index of the array.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): List of maximum jump lengths at each position.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the last index can be reached, otherwise False.
    """
    max_reachable = 0  # Track the farthest index that can be reached
    n = len(nums)

    for i in range(n):
        if i > max_reachable:
            return False  # Cannot reach this index
        max_reachable = max(max_reachable, i + nums[i])
        if max_reachable >= n - 1:
            return True  # Reached or passed the last index

    return False

# Examples
print(canJump([2, 3, 1, 1, 4]))  # Output: True
print(canJump([3, 2, 1, 0, 4]))  # Output: False

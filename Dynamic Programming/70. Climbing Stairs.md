# 70. Climbing Stairs

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Status:** Solved  

## Topics
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Recursion**

## Problem Statement
You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

## Approach

This is a classic dynamic programming problem. The number of distinct ways to reach the top depends on the previous two steps. 

- If you are currently on step `n`, you can get there either from step `n-1` (by taking 1 step) or from step `n-2` (by taking 2 steps). Therefore, the total number of ways to get to step `n` is the sum of the ways to get to steps `n-1` and `n-2`.

We can use dynamic programming (DP) to build up the solution iteratively. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of ways to reach the `i`-th step. Then, the recurrence relation is:
- `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]` for `i >= 2`
- Base cases: `dp[0] = 1` (1 way to stay at the ground), `dp[1] = 1` (1 way to reach the first step).

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        """
        Returns the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of the staircase with n steps.
        
        Parameters:
        n (int): The number of steps to the top.
        
        Returns:
        int: The number of distinct ways to reach the top.
        """
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        
        # Initialize base cases
        first, second = 1, 2
        
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            # The number of ways to get to step i is the sum of the ways to get to step i-1 and i-2
            first, second = second, first + second
        
        return second

# 39. Combination Sum

**Status:** Solved  
**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem Description

Given an array of distinct integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return a list of all unique combinations of `candidates` where the chosen numbers sum to `target`. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from `candidates` an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to the target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

## Example

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`candidates = [2,3,6,7]`, `target = 7`

**Output:**  
`[[2, 2, 3], [7]]`

**Explanation:**  
- [2, 2, 3] sums up to 7.
- [7] sums up to 7.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`candidates = [2,3,5]`, `target = 8`

**Output:**  
`[[2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 3, 3], [3, 5]]`

**Explanation:**  
- [2, 2, 2, 2] sums up to 8.
- [2, 3, 3] sums up to 8.
- [3, 5] sums up to 8.

## Constraints:
- `1 <= candidates.length <= 30`
- `2 <= candidates[i] <= 40`
- All elements of `candidates` are distinct.
- `1 <= target <= 40`
- The number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

## Solution

We can solve this problem using a backtracking approach. Here's how it works:

1. Start with an empty combination and recursively explore the candidates.
2. For each candidate, either include it in the current combination or move to the next candidate.
3. If the combination's sum matches the target, add it to the result.
4. If the sum exceeds the target, backtrack and explore other possibilities.
5. Since we can pick the same number multiple times, the backtracking step allows revisiting the same candidate.

### Python Code:

```python
def combinationSum(candidates, target):
    result = []
    
    def backtrack(start, target, current_combination):
        # Base case: if the target is zero, add the current combination to result
        if target == 0:
            result.append(list(current_combination))
            return
        # Try each candidate starting from 'start'
        for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
            # If the candidate is greater than the remaining target, skip it
            if candidates[i] > target:
                continue
            # Add the candidate to the current combination
            current_combination.append(candidates[i])
            # Recur with the updated target and the current candidate index
            backtrack(i, target - candidates[i], current_combination)
            # Backtrack by removing the last added candidate
            current_combination.pop()
    
    # Start the backtracking process
    backtrack(0, target, [])
    return result

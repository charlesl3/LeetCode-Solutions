**Difficulty:** Medium

---

## Problem Description

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, but adjacent houses have security systems connected. If two adjacent houses are broken into on the same night, the police will automatically be alerted.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money at each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`nums = [1,2,3,1]`  
**Output:**  
`4`  
**Explanation:**  
Rob house 1 (money = 1) and house 3 (money = 3).  
Total amount robbed = `1 + 3 = 4`.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`nums = [2,7,9,3,1]`  
**Output:**  
`12`  
**Explanation:**  
Rob house 1 (money = 2), house 3 (money = 9), and house 5 (money = 1).  
Total amount robbed = `2 + 9 + 1 = 12`.

---

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`

---

## Solution: Python

Hereâ€™s a Python solution using **Dynamic Programming**:

```python
def rob(nums):
    """
    Calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed without alerting the police.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): List of amounts of money in each house.

    Returns:
        int: Maximum amount that can be robbed.
    """
    if not nums:
        return 0
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]

    # Initialize the DP array
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = nums[0]
    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])

    # Fill the DP array
    for i in range(2, n):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i])

    return dp[-1]

# Examples
print(rob([1, 2, 3, 1]))  # Output: 4
print(rob([2, 7, 9, 3, 1]))  # Output: 12

# 213. House Robber II

**Difficulty:** Medium

---

## Problem Description

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. Unlike the first problem, all houses in this scenario are arranged in a **circle**, meaning the first house is the neighbor of the last one. 

If two adjacent houses are broken into on the same night, the security system will automatically contact the police.  

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money in each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`nums = [2,3,2]`  
**Output:**  
`3`  
**Explanation:**  
You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and house 3 (money = 2) because they are adjacent houses.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`nums = [1,2,3,1]`  
**Output:**  
`4`  
**Explanation:**  
Rob house 1 (money = 1) and house 3 (money = 3).  
Total amount robbed = `1 + 3 = 4`.

---

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`nums = [1,2,3]`  
**Output:**  
`3`

---

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

---

## Solution: Python

Hereâ€™s a Python solution using **Dynamic Programming**:

```python
def rob(nums):
    """
    Calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed without alerting the police.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): List of amounts of money in each house.

    Returns:
        int: Maximum amount that can be robbed.
    """
    # Edge cases
    if not nums:
        return 0
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]

    def rob_linear(houses):
        """
        Helper function to solve the linear version of the house robber problem.
        """
        n = len(houses)
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return houses[0]

        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = houses[0]
        dp[1] = max(houses[0], houses[1])

        for i in range(2, n):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + houses[i])

        return dp[-1]

    # Exclude either the first house or the last house and take the maximum
    return max(rob_linear(nums[:-1]), rob_linear(nums[1:]))

# Examples
print(rob([2, 3, 2]))  # Output: 3
print(rob([1, 2, 3, 1]))  # Output: 4
print(rob([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 3

# 322. Coin Change

**Difficulty:** Medium

---

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`coins = [1, 2, 5]`, `amount = 11`  
**Output:**  
`3`  
**Explanation:**  
`11 = 5 + 5 + 1`

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`coins = [2]`, `amount = 3`  
**Output:**  
`-1`

---

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`coins = [1]`, `amount = 0`  
**Output:**  
`0`

---

## Constraints
- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= amount <= 10^4`

---

## Solution: Python

Hereâ€™s a more readable Python solution using **Dynamic Programming**:

```python
def coinChange(coins, amount):
    """
    Find the minimum number of coins needed to make up the given amount.
    
    Args:
        coins (List[int]): Available denominations of coins.
        amount (int): Target amount to achieve.
    
    Returns:
        int: Minimum number of coins needed, or -1 if impossible.
    """
    # Create a DP array to store the minimum coins needed for each amount
    min_coins = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    min_coins[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins are needed to make amount 0

    # Iterate through all amounts from 1 to the target amount
    for current_amount in range(1, amount + 1):
        # Check each coin denomination
        for coin in coins:
            if current_amount >= coin:
                # Update the DP value for the current amount
                min_coins[current_amount] = min(min_coins[current_amount], 
                                                min_coins[current_amount - coin] + 1)

    # Return the result, or -1 if no combination of coins can make the amount
    return min_coins[amount] if min_coins[amount] != float('inf') else -1

# Examples
print(coinChange([1, 2, 5], 11))  # Output: 3
print(coinChange([2], 3))         # Output: -1
print(coinChange([1], 0))         # Output: 0

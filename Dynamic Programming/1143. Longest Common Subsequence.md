## Problem Statement

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their **longest common subsequence**. If there is no common subsequence, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted **without changing the relative order** of the remaining characters.  
For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.  

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

## Example

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
```python
text1 = "abcde"
text2 = "ace"
```

Output:
3

## Code
```python

class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1, text2):
        """
        This method finds the length of the longest common subsequence between two strings.
        :param text1: First input string
        :param text2: Second input string
        :return: Length of the longest common subsequence
        """
        # Get the lengths of both input strings
        m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
        
        # Initialize a 2D DP table with dimensions (m+1) x (n+1), filled with zeros
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

        # Iterate through each character of text1 (outer loop)
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            # Iterate through each character of text2 (inner loop)
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                # If the characters match, the LCS length increases by 1
                if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                # If the characters do not match, the LCS length is the max of excluding one character
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

        # The length of the longest common subsequence is found in dp[m][n]
        return dp[m][n]

## Problem Description

You are given the `head` of a singly linked list. The list can be represented as:

`L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln`

Reorder the list to be in the following form:

`L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …`

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

---

### Examples

#### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`head = [1,2,3,4]`

**Output:**  
`[1,4,2,3]`

---

#### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`head = [1,2,3,4,5]`

**Output:**  
`[1,5,2,4,3]`

---

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5 * 10^4]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`

---

### Approach

1. **Find the Middle of the List:**  
   Use the **slow and fast pointer** technique to find the middle of the linked list.
   
2. **Reverse the Second Half of the List:**  
   After finding the middle, reverse the second half of the list starting from the middle node.

3. **Merge the Two Halves:**  
   Use two pointers to merge the first half and the reversed second half alternately.

### Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reorderList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        # Helper function to find the middle of the list
        def find_middle(head):
            slow = head
            fast = head
            while fast and fast.next:
                slow = slow.next
                fast = fast.next.next
            return slow
        
        # Helper function to reverse the linked list
        def reverse_list(head):
            prev = None
            curr = head
            while curr:
                next_temp = curr.next
                curr.next = prev
                prev = curr
                curr = next_temp
            return prev
        
        # Helper function to merge two lists
        def merge_lists(first_half, second_half):
            while second_half:
                temp1 = first_half.next
                temp2 = second_half.next
                first_half.next = second_half
                second_half.next = temp1
                first_half = temp1
                second_half = temp2
        
        # Edge case: if the list is empty or has one node
        if not head or not head.next:
            return None
        
        # Step 1: Find the middle of the list
        middle = find_middle(head)
        
        # Step 2: Reverse the second half of the list
        second_half = reverse_list(middle.next)
        middle.next = None  # Split the list into two halves
        
        # Step 3: Merge the two halves
        merge_lists(head, second_half)

# 206. Reverse Linked List

**Status:** Solved  
**Difficulty:** Easy  

## Topics
- Linked Lists
- Iteration
- Recursion

## Problem Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

### Examples

#### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`head = [1,2,3,4,5]`  

**Output:**  
`[5,4,3,2,1]`

---

#### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`head = [1,2]`  

**Output:**  
`[2,1]`

---

#### Example 3:

**Input:**  
`head = []`  

**Output:**  
`[]`

---

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

---

### Approach

#### Iterative Solution:
1. Initialize two pointers: `prev` as `null` and `current` as `head`.
2. Traverse the list. For each node:
   - Save the next node.
   - Reverse the `current` node's pointer to point to `prev`.
   - Move `prev` and `current` one step forward.
3. Return `prev` as the new head of the reversed list.

#### Recursive Solution:
1. Base case: If `head` is `null` or thereâ€™s only one node, return `head`.
2. Recursively reverse the rest of the list.
3. Adjust the pointers to reverse the current node.

```python
# Iterative Solution
def reverseList(head):
    prev = None
    current = head
    while current:
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next_node
    return prev

# Recursive Solution
def reverseListRecursive(head):
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head
    reversed_list = reverseListRecursive(head.next)
    head.next.next = head
    head.next = None
    return reversed_list

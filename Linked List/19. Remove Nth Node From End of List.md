## Problem Description

Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `nth` node from the end of the list and return its head.

---

### Examples

#### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2`  

**Output:**  
`[1,2,3,5]`

---

#### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`head = [1], n = 1`  

**Output:**  
`[]`

---

#### Example 3:

**Input:**  
`head = [1,2], n = 1`  

**Output:**  
`[1]`

---

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 30]`.
- `1 <= n <= length of list`
- The list is guaranteed to have at least one node.

---

### Approach

#### Two-Pointer Technique:
1. Initialize two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, both starting at the head of the list.
2. Move `fast` forward by `n` steps.
3. Then, move both `fast` and `slow` one step at a time until `fast.next` becomes `null`.
4. At this point, `slow` will be just before the node to be deleted.
5. Modify the `slow.next` pointer to skip the `nth` node and return the updated list.

### Solution

```python
def removeNthFromEnd(head, n):
    # Create a dummy node to simplify edge cases (like removing the first node)
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    fast = slow = dummy
    
    # Move fast pointer n steps ahead
    for _ in range(n):
        fast = fast.next
    
    # Move both pointers until fast reaches the end
    while fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next
    
    # Remove the nth node from the end
    slow.next = slow.next.next
    
    return dummy.next

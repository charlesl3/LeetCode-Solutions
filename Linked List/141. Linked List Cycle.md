## Problem Description

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that the tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.**

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Examples

#### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1`  

**Output:**  
`true`  

**Explanation:**  
There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

---

#### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`head = [1,2], pos = 0`  

**Output:**  
`true`  

**Explanation:**  
There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

---

#### Example 3:

**Input:**  
`head = [1], pos = -1`  

**Output:**  
`false`  

**Explanation:**  
There is no cycle in the linked list.

---

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`.
- `pos` is `-1` if there is no cycle in the linked list.

---

### Approach

#### Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (Two-Pointer Technique):
1. Use two pointers: `slow` and `fast`.
2. Initialize both pointers to `head`.
3. Move `slow` by one step and `fast` by two steps in each iteration.
4. If `slow` and `fast` meet, a cycle exists; return `true`.
5. If `fast` or `fast.next` becomes `null`, there is no cycle; return `false`.

### Solution

```python
def hasCycle(head):
    if not head or not head.next:
        return False
    
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    
    return False

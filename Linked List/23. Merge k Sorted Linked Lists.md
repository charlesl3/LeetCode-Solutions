# Merge k Sorted Linked Lists

**Difficulty**: Hard

---

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of `k` linked lists, where each linked list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked lists into one sorted linked list and return its head.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input**:  
`lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]`  

**Output**:  
`[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]`

**Explanation**:  
The linked lists are:  
- `1 -> 4 -> 5`  
- `1 -> 3 -> 4`  
- `2 -> 6`  

Merging them results in:  
`1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`.

---

### Example 2:

**Input**:  
`lists = []`  

**Output**:  
`[]`

---

### Example 3:

**Input**:  
`lists = [[]]`  

**Output**:  
`[]`

---

## Constraints

- `k == lists.length`
- `0 <= k <= 10^4`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
- The linked lists are sorted in **ascending order**.
- The total number of nodes in all linked lists is at most `10^4`.

## Solution (Python)

### Approach 1: Using a Min-Heap

```python
import heapq

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists):
        """
        :type lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        # Create a min-heap
        heap = []
        
        # Add the first node of each list to the heap
        for i, lst in enumerate(lists):
            if lst:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (lst.val, i, lst))
        
        # Dummy node to simplify result list construction
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        current = dummy
        
        while heap:
            # Extract the smallest element from the heap
            val, i, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
            current.next = node
            current = current.next
            
            # If there are more nodes in the current list, push the next one
            if node.next:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, i, node.next))
        
        return dummy.next

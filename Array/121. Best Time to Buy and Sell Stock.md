# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Problem Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution Approach

### Two-Pointer Sliding Window Approach

- **Goal**: Track the minimum price and compute the maximum profit.
- **Steps**:
  1. Iterate through the list of prices.
  2. Keep track of the minimum price seen so far.
  3. Calculate the profit if the stock were sold at the current price.
  4. Update the maximum profit if the calculated profit is higher.

### Code

```python
def maxProfit(prices):
    # Initialize the minimum price as infinity and max profit as 0
    min_price = float('inf')
    max_profit = 0

    # Iterate over each price in the list
    for price in prices:
        # Update the minimum price if the current price is lower
        min_price = min(min_price, price)
        # Calculate the potential profit if sold at the current price
        profit = price - min_price
        # Update the max profit if the calculated profit is higher
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)

    return max_profit
```

### With Dynamic Programming

```python

class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not prices:
            return 0

        # Initialize dp array to store the max profit up to each day
        n = len(prices)
        dp = [0] * n
        min_price_so_far = prices[0]

        # Fill the dp array by calculating max profit at each day
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Option 1: Hold, so profit is the same as the previous day
            hold_profit = dp[i-1]

            # Option 2: Sell on day i, so profit is prices[i] - min_price_so_far
            sell_profit = prices[i] - min_price_so_far

            # Calculate dp[i] as the max profit on day i
            dp[i] = max(hold_profit, sell_profit)

            # Update the minimum price observed so far
            min_price_so_far = min(min_price_so_far, prices[i])

        # The answer is the maximum profit up to the last day
        return dp[-1]

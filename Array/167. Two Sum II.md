# 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

**Companies**: Amazon, Microsoft, Google  

## Problem Statement  
Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already **sorted** in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number.  

Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.  

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, **added by one** as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length `2`.  

The tests are generated such that **there is exactly one solution**. You may not use the same element twice.  

Your solution **must use only constant extra space**.

### **Example 1**
#### **Input:**
```python
numbers = [2,7,11,15]
target = 9
```

### Solution

```python

class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, numbers, target):
        for i in range(len(numbers)):
            complement = target - numbers[i]
            idx = bisect.bisect_left(numbers, complement, i + 1)
            
            # Check if the found index is within bounds and matches the complement
            if idx < len(numbers) and numbers[idx] == complement:
                return [i + 1, idx + 1]  # Convert to 1-based index

        return []

# Container With Most Water

## Problem
You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`th line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

**Note**: You may not slant the container.

## Solution

### Approach
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a **two-pointer technique**:
1. Start with two pointers: one at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the `height` array.
2. Calculate the area of water that can be held between the lines at the `left` and `right` pointers. The area is determined by the smaller of the two heights (`min(height[left], height[right])`) and the width between the two lines (`right - left`).
3. Move the pointer corresponding to the smaller height inward, as the area can only increase if a taller line is encountered.
4. Continue this process until the two pointers meet.

This approach ensures that we examine all potential containers with a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `height` array.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `height` array. We only make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are only using a constant amount of extra space for the pointers and the maximum area.

### Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0
        
        while left < right:
            # Calculate the area
            width = right - left
            current_area = min(height[left], height[right]) * width
            max_area = max(max_area, current_area)
            
            # Move the pointer corresponding to the smaller height
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        
        return max_area

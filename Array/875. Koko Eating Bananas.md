## Problem Statement  

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, and the `i`th pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.  

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has fewer than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during that hour.  

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.  

Return the minimum integer `k` such that she can eat all the bananas within `h` hours.

## Examples  

### Example 1  

**Input:**  
piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8

**Output:**  
4

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles, h):
        # Binary search boundaries
        left, right = 1, max(piles)

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2  # Middle speed to test
            
            # Calculate total hours needed to eat all bananas at speed 'mid'
            hours = sum((pile + mid - 1) // mid for pile in piles)
            
            # If total hours required at speed 'mid' is less than or equal to h
            if hours <= h:
                right = mid  # Try for a smaller speed
            else:
                left = mid + 1  # Increase speed since it's too slow
        
        return left  # The minimum speed k that works

# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it and then immediately sell it on the same day.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution Approach

### Greedy Approach

- **Goal**: Maximize profit by summing up all positive price differences between consecutive days.
- **Steps**:
  1. Iterate through the prices array.
  2. For each day, if the price of the next day is higher than the current day, add the difference to the profit.
  3. This approach works because we only accumulate profit for profitable transactions and ignore downward trends.

### Code

```python
def maxProfit(prices):
    max_profit = 0

    # Loop through prices, adding up every increase
    for i in range(1, len(prices)):
        # If there is a profit to be made by selling today, add it to max_profit
        if prices[i] > prices[i - 1]:
            max_profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]

    return max_profit

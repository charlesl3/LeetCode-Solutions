# Product of Array Except for Self

## Problem
Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

## Solution

### Approach
The problem can be solved in two passes over the array:
1. **First pass (Left Products)**: We calculate the cumulative product of all elements before each index `i` and store it in the `answer` array.
2. **Second pass (Right Products)**: We calculate the cumulative product of all elements after each index `i`, and multiply it directly to the corresponding position in the `answer` array.

By combining both passes, we compute the result in O(n) time while keeping the space complexity to O(1) (excluding the output array).

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. We make two passes over the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), if we exclude the output array `answer`.

### Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        LEN = len(nums)
        answer = [1] * LEN

        # First pass: Calculate left products and store in answer
        for i in range(1, LEN):
            answer[i] = answer[i - 1] * nums[i - 1]
        
        # Second pass: Calculate right products and multiply to answer
        mul = 1
        for i in range(LEN - 1, -1, -1):
            answer[i] *= mul
            mul *= nums[i]

        return answer

# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee

## Problem
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day, and an integer `fee` representing the transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

## Solution

### Approach
We use dynamic programming to track two states:
1. `cash`: Maximum profit if we do not hold any stock on a particular day.
2. `hold`: Maximum profit if we are holding a stock on a particular day.

For each day, we update the values of `cash` and `hold`:
- `cash`: Either we do nothing (keep the previous `cash`), or we sell the stock (adding the profit from selling).
- `hold`: Either we do nothing (keep the previous `hold`), or we buy the stock (subtracting the price from `cash`).

The final result will be stored in `cash`, representing the maximum profit when not holding any stock on the last day.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of days (length of the `prices` array).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use two variables (`cash` and `hold`) to store the current states.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices, fee):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :type fee: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # Initialize states: profit if no stock is held (no_stock_profit) and profit if stock is held (holding_stock_profit)
        no_stock_profit = 0              # Profit when you’re not holding any stock
        holding_stock_profit = -prices[0] # Profit when you’re holding a stock, starting by buying at prices[0]

        # Process each day's price after the first day
        for price in prices[1:]:
            # Decision 1: Update no_stock_profit (profit if no stock is held)
            # - Choose between:
            #   1. Keeping the same profit as the previous day (staying without stock)
            #   2. Selling the stock today if we are holding one
            #      Profit from selling = current price - fee + holding_stock_profit
            no_stock_profit = max(no_stock_profit, holding_stock_profit + price - fee)

            # Decision 2: Update holding_stock_profit (profit if holding a stock)
            # - Choose between:
            #   1. Keeping the same profit from the previous day (continuing to hold stock)
            #   2. Buying a new stock today, spending today's price
            #      Profit from buying = no_stock_profit - price
            holding_stock_profit = max(holding_stock_profit, no_stock_profit - price)

        # Final profit is no_stock_profit because we aim to end without holding any stock
        return no_stock_profit

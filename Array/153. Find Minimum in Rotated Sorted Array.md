# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## Problem

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:  
- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated 4 times.  
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated 7 times (a full rotation).  

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of unique elements, return the **minimum element** of this array.  

You must write an algorithm that runs in **O(log n)** time.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**: `nums = [3,4,5,1,2]`  
**Output**: `1`  
**Explanation**: The original array was `[1,2,3,4,5]` rotated 3 times.

### Example 2
**Input**: `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`  
**Output**: `0`  
**Explanation**: The original array was `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` and it was rotated 4 times.

### Example 3
**Input**: `nums = [11,13,15,17]`  
**Output**: `11`  
**Explanation**: The original array was `[11,13,15,17]` and it was rotated 4 times.

## Approach

### Binary Search
- Use a binary search approach to locate the pivot point where the rotation happens.
- Compare the middle element with the rightmost element to determine which side the minimum lies on.
  - If `nums[mid] > nums[right]`: The minimum is to the **right** of `mid`.
  - Else: The minimum is to the **left** of `mid` or it is `mid`.

- **Complexity**:
  - **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)` due to binary search.
  - **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` since we use constant extra space.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2

            # If mid element is greater than the rightmost element, the minimum is to the right
            if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                # Otherwise, the minimum is at mid or to the left
                right = mid

        # At the end of the loop, left == right
        return nums[left]

# 739. Daily Temperatures

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topics:** Stack, Array, Monotonic Stack  
**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Microsoft  

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `temperatures` representing the daily temperatures, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the number of days you have to wait after the `i`th day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, set `answer[i] = 0`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]`  

**Output:**  
`[1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]`  

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`temperatures = [30,40,50,60]`  

**Output:**  
`[1,1,1,0]`  

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`temperatures = [30,60,90]`  

**Output:**  
`[1,1,0]`

## Solution: Monotonic Stack Approach

We use a **monotonic decreasing stack** to efficiently compute the number of days until a warmer temperature.
```python
class Solution(object):
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures):
        """
        :type temperatures: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        n = len(temperatures)
        answer = [0] * n  # Initialize result array with 0
        stack = []  # Stack to store indices
        
        for i, temp in enumerate(temperatures):
            while stack and temperatures[stack[-1]] < temp:
                prev_index = stack.pop()
                answer[prev_index] = i - prev_index  # Days to wait
            stack.append(i)  # Push current index to stack
        
        return answer

```
### Algorithm

1. **Use a Stack**: Store indices of temperatures in a stack.
2. **Iterate Over the Array**:
   - If the current temperature is **higher** than the temperature at the top of the stack, update the answer for that index.
   - Continue popping from the stack until it is empty or the top element has a higher temperature.
3. **Store the Difference**: For each popped element, compute `i - prev_index` and store it in `answer[prev_index]`.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)` (Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once).  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` (In the worst case, all elements are in the stack).

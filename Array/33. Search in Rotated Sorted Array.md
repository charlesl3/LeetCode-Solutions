# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## Problem

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).  

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index `k` (1 <= `k` < `nums.length`) such that the resulting array is:  
`[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (0-indexed).  

For example:  
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.  

Given the array `nums` after the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return the index of `target` if it is in `nums`, or `-1` if it is not.  

You must write an algorithm with **O(log n)** runtime complexity.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**:  
`nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`, `target = 0`  
**Output**: `4`

### Example 2
**Input**:  
`nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`, `target = 3`  
**Output**: `-1`

### Example 3
**Input**:  
`nums = [1]`, `target = 0`  
**Output**: `-1`

## Approach

### Binary Search
- Use a binary search approach to find the target in the rotated array.
- The key observation is that at least one of the halves of the array (left or right of `mid`) will always be sorted.

**Steps**:
1. Check if the `target` lies in the sorted half of the array:
   - If `nums[left] <= nums[mid]`: Left half is sorted.
   - Else: Right half is sorted.
2. Adjust the search range (`left`, `right`) accordingly to continue searching for `target`.

- **Complexity**:
  - **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)` due to binary search.
  - **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` as no additional space is used.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2

            # Check if mid is the target
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid

            # Check if left half is sorted
            if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:
                # Check if target is in the sorted left half
                if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:
                    right = mid - 1
                else:
                    left = mid + 1
            else:
                # Right half is sorted
                if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid - 1

        # Target not found
        return -1

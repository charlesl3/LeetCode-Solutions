# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

## Problem Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).
- You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= prices.length <= 5000`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

## Solution Approach

### Dynamic Programming Approach

- **Goal**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of three states for each day:
  1. `hold`: Maximum profit if we are holding a stock.
  2. `sold`: Maximum profit if we just sold a stock.
  3. `cooldown`: Maximum profit if we are in the cooldown phase.
  
- **Steps**:
  1. Initialize these states to track profits based on whether we're holding, selling, or cooling down.
  2. Update each state for each day, based on the previous day's values.
  3. The answer will be the maximum of `sold` or `cooldown` on the last day.

### Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not prices:
            return 0

        n = len(prices)
        hold = [0] * n
        sell = [0] * n
        cooldown = [0] * n

        # Initial values
        hold[0] = -prices[0]  # Buy on day 0
        sell[0] = 0           # Can't sell on day 0
        cooldown[0] = 0       # No cooldown on day 0

        for i in range(1, n):
            hold[i] = max(hold[i-1], cooldown[i-1] - prices[i])  # Max profit if holding stock
            sell[i] = hold[i-1] + prices[i]                        # Sell stock
            cooldown[i] = max(cooldown[i-1], sell[i-1])           # Cooldown state

        return max(sell[n-1], cooldown[n-1], hold[n-1])

# Contains Duplicate

## Problem
Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

## Solution

### Approach
We can solve this problem efficiently by using a hash set to track the elements we've seen so far. As we iterate through the array:
- If the current element already exists in the set, we return `true` because a duplicate is found.
- If the element does not exist in the set, we add it to the set.

This approach ensures that we check for duplicates in linear time.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. We only need one pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of unique elements, since we store them in a hash set.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        seen = set()
        
        for num in nums:
            if num in seen:
                return True
            seen.add(num)
        
        return False

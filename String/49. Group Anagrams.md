## Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the **anagrams** together. You can return the answer in any order.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`  

**Output:**  
`[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]`  

**Explanation:**  
- `"bat"` does not have any other strings in `strs` that can be rearranged to form it.  
- `"nat"` and `"tan"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.  
- `"ate"`, `"eat"`, and `"tea"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`strs = [""]`  

**Output:**  
`[[""]]`  

---

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`strs = ["a"]`  

**Output:**  
`[["a"]]`  

---

## Solution

### Approach:
To solve the problem, we group anagrams by creating a unique identifier for each group. A common approach is to use the **sorted version of each string** as a key since anagrams will have the same sorted version.

Alternatively, we can use a **character count tuple** as the key for more efficiency when the strings are very long or contain many repeated characters.

---

### Implementation in Python:

#### Using Sorted Strings:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def groupAnagrams(strs: list[str]) -> list[list[str]]:
    anagrams = defaultdict(list)
    for s in strs:
        # Sort the string to create a key
        key = "".join(sorted(s))
        anagrams[key].append(s)
    return list(anagrams.values())

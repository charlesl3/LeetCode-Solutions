## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`s = "ABAB", k = 2`  
**Output:**  
`4`  
**Explanation:**  
Replace the two `'A's` with two `'B's` or vice versa.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`s = "AABABBA", k = 1`  
**Output:**  
`4`  
**Explanation:**  
Replace the one `'A'` in the middle with `'B'` to form `"AABBBBA"`.  
The substring `"BBBB"` has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.  

> **Note:** There may exist other ways to achieve this answer too.

## Solution

### Approach:
We use the **sliding window** technique to maintain a window of valid substrings. The key insight is that the maximum number of changes needed to make all characters in the window the same is the window size minus the count of the most frequent character in the window.

### Implementation in Python:
```python
def characterReplacement(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    max_count = 0
    char_count = {}
    left = 0
    max_length = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        char_count[s[right]] = char_count.get(s[right], 0) + 1
        max_count = max(max_count, char_count[s[right]])
        
        while (right - left + 1) - max_count > k:
            char_count[s[left]] -= 1
            left += 1

        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

    return max_length

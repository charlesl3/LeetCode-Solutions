## Problem Statement

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"`  

**Output:**  
`true`  

**Explanation:**  
After removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase, `"amanaplanacanalpanama"` is a palindrome.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`s = "race a car"`  

**Output:**  
`false`  

**Explanation:**  
After removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase, `"raceacar"` is not a palindrome.

---

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`s = " "`  

**Output:**  
`true`  

**Explanation:**  
The input is an empty string after removing non-alphanumeric characters. An empty string reads the same forward and backward, so it is a palindrome.

---

## Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10⁵`
- `s` consists of printable ASCII characters.

---

## Solution

### Approach:
We can solve this problem using the **two-pointer technique**:
1. Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the string.
2. Move the `left` pointer forward and the `right` pointer backward, skipping non-alphanumeric characters.
3. At each step, compare the characters at the `left` and `right` pointers. If they don't match, return `false`.
4. Continue this process until the pointers meet or cross. If no mismatch is found, return `true`.

### Implementation in Python:

```python
def isPalindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        # Skip non-alphanumeric characters
        if not s[left].isalnum():
            left += 1
        elif not s[right].isalnum():
            right -= 1
        else:
            # Compare characters, case insensitive
            if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
                return False
            left += 1
            right -= 1
            
    return True


class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        s = s.lower()
        filtered_chars = []
        for char in s:
            if char.isalnum():
                filtered_chars.append(char)

        # Check if the filtered string is a palindrome
        return filtered_chars == filtered_chars[::-1]

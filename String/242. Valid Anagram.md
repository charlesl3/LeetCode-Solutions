## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an **anagram** of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"`  
**Output:**  
`true`  

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`s = "rat", t = "car"`  
**Output:**  
`false`  

---

## Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10⁴`  
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.  

---

## Follow-Up:
What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?  
> Instead of using fixed-size arrays or hash maps for 26 letters, consider using a more general data structure, like Python's `collections.Counter`, to handle characters with arbitrary encodings.

---

## Solution

### Approach:
Two common approaches to solving this problem are:
1. **Sorting:** Sort both strings and compare them. Anagrams will have identical sorted versions.
2. **Hash Table (Frequency Count):** Count the frequency of each character in both strings and compare the results.

### Implementation in Python:

#### Using Sorting:
```python
import unicodedata
class Solution(object):
    def isAnagram(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        s_normalized = unicodedata.normalize('NFC', s)
        t_normalized = unicodedata.normalize('NFC', t)
        return sorted(s_normalized) == sorted(t_normalized)

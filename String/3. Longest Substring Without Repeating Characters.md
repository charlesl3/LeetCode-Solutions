## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`s = "abcabcbb"`  
**Output:**  
`3`  
**Explanation:**  
The answer is `"abc"`, with the length of 3.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`s = "bbbbb"`  
**Output:**  
`1`  
**Explanation:**  
The answer is `"b"`, with the length of 1.

---

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`s = "pwwkew"`  
**Output:**  
`3`  
**Explanation:**  
The answer is `"wke"`, with the length of 3.  

> **Note:** The answer must be a substring. `"pwke"` is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Solution

### Approach:
We use the **sliding window** technique with a hash set to track characters in the current substring. The window expands by adding characters one by one until a duplicate is found. At that point, we shrink the window by removing characters from the start until the duplicate is resolved.

### Implementation in Python:
```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
    char_set = set()
    left = 0
    max_length = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        char_set.add(s[right])
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

    return max_length

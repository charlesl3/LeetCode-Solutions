## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`s = "()"`  

**Output:**  
`true`

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`s = "()[]{}"`  

**Output:**  
`true`

---

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`s = "(]"`  

**Output:**  
`false`

---

### Example 4:
**Input:**  
`s = "([])"`  

**Output:**  
`true`

---

## Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 10⁴`
- `s` consists of parentheses only: `'()[]{}'`.

---

## Solution

### Approach:
To determine if the string has valid parentheses, we can use a **stack**:
1. Traverse the string from left to right.
2. For every opening parenthesis, push it onto the stack.
3. For every closing parenthesis, check if the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack is the matching opening parenthesis. If true, pop the stack; otherwise, return false.
4. After the loop, if the stack is empty, return true (all parentheses were matched); otherwise, return false (there are unmatched opening parentheses).

### Implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isValid(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        ack = []
        lookfor = {')':'(', '}':'{', ']':'['}

        for p in s:
            if p in lookfor.values():
                ack.append(p)
            elif ack and lookfor[p] == ack[-1]:
                ack.pop()
            else:
                return False

        return ack == []

# 205. Isomorphic Strings

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Hash Table, String  
**Companies:** Multiple  

## Problem Statement  

Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are **isomorphic**.  

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.  

- All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters.  
- No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.  

## Examples  

### Example 1:  
**Input:**  
```python
s = "egg"
t = "add"
```

### Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isIsomorphic(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        # Dictionaries to track the mappings
        s_to_t = {}
        t_to_s = {}

        # Iterate through both strings
        for char_s, char_t in zip(s, t):
            # Check if s -> t mapping exists and is consistent
            if char_s in s_to_t:
                if s_to_t[char_s] != char_t:
                    return False
            else:
                s_to_t[char_s] = char_t

            # Check if t -> s mapping exists and is consistent
            if char_t in t_to_s:
                 if t_to_s[char_t] != char_s:
                     return False
            else:
                 t_to_s[char_t] = char_s

        return True
